# It's yet another clock project!

This is a clock.  Yes, it tells the time and stuff.  Eventually, I'm going to
build it with some nice 40mm Kingbright bicolour LED displays, but for now
I'm prototyping it with conventionally-sized ones.

C source code for the microcontroller will be committed once I've written
some.

At present, I've only breadboarded the circuit.  There's some flicker, but
it may go away when I've used a real PCB... got quite the rat's-nest and
there could be any number of wiring faults.

Dependencies: Other than the gEDA suite, this project uses my symbol library
(also in GitHub) and one or two footprints from John Luciani's library.

Complaints to brad@facefault.org.

License: WTFPL version 2. Google it if you haven't seen the acronym before.
(Summary: do whatever you want with it.)
